Hello There!! I am

- 6 Kyu as [meet_the_horizon](https://atcoder.jp/users/meet_the_horizon) @[AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp)

I have been doing competitive programming from May, 2023 (with a lot of breaks), this is my environment of writing codes. 
I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) with [Cpp​Fast​Olympic​Coding](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CppFastOlympicCoding) as my primary plugin 
and Snippets!! (can't live without 'em)

You can find all of my Snippets in the the snippets directory, just copy them to the user directory of Sublime and use them!!

I have been building some solutions for AtCoder Educational Contest and CSES (though still much is left)

**TODO**
- [ ] Complete AtCoder Educational Contest
- [ ] Complete CSES Problem Set
- [ ] Complete Euler Project
